# ToDo App

A small simple app I'm making to improve and display my skills. I made the app in linux, used all the git version control in CLI and I write the readme in Vim. 
needlessly complicated to learn. I also decided to use recylcerView which is probably the most complicated way to display a list of mutable tasks. 

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add tasks with due dates to keep track of your activities.
- **Delete Tasks:** Delete tasks with a single click

## Known-Issues

- RecyclerView doesn't seem to update after adding a task, you need to add another or switch fragments back and forth

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java XML Junit
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Android SDK, Unit Testing
